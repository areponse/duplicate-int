# Double Int

Double Int is a solution to the "Double Integers" programming assignment for Enterprise Web Development students. The script reads a list of integers from an input file, identifies duplicate integers, and generates an output file containing the sorted duplicate integers.

## Features

- Reads a list of integers from an input file.
- Identifies duplicate integers.
- Sorts the duplicate integers in increasing order.
- Outputs the sorted duplicate integers to an output file.
- Handles various input file formats and edge cases.

## Usage

To use Double Int, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository or download the script file (`DoubleInt.py`).
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing the script.
- Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python DoubleInt.py <input_file_path>
```

Replace `<input_file_path>` with the path to your input file.

## Sample Input

The input file should contain one integer per line, with optional whitespace characters before or after each integer.

For testing purposes, there are sample inputs saved in directory `sample_inputs`

## Sample Output

The output file will contain a list of double integers sorted in increasing order, with one integer per line. The results have same name as the input with `_result` and saved in `sample_results` directory

## Requirements

Python 3.x
